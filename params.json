{"name":"AutoMute","tagline":"Mute or unmute your MacBook based on your current wifi network","body":"# AutoMute - [Download Version 1.1 Here](http://bit.ly/AutoMute1-1)\r\n\r\nHave a MacBook that you use both for work and personal use? Constantly forgetting to mute your sound when you get to school or work?\r\n\r\n![Closing Laptop](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d89f9646e730659b163c31d653f96c3299694e42/687474703a2f2f6769616e742e6766796361742e636f6d2f436f6e7363696f757346656d696e696e654972756b616e646a696a656c6c79666973682e676966)\r\n\r\nAutoMute allows you to tell your computer to mute or unmute your Macbook when you connect to certain wifi networks, eliminating the need to remember to mute and unmute your laptop and giving you the peace of mind that your laptop won't start playing sounds in the middle of class or in the office.\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n![AutoMute Menu](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a4f0ca40d841e12eee31277e2bb0648081fdd735/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f527763506871662e706e67)\r\n\r\n![AutoMute Setup](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/87c49a62f101a0720238e0feaea3541f7699e53e/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6e4852627748482e706e67)\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\nAutoMute has a super easy one-time setup. When you first launch the app, it shows a list of your most recently used wifi networks and you tell it what you want to happen when you connect to each one. Once everything is set up, you can close the preferences window and AutoMute will work in the background. \r\n\r\nAs long as you see the AutoMute icon on your status bar, AutoMute is working. This is also where you can change the settings any time you like.\r\n\r\n# Version History\r\n###1.0 (September 2015)\r\nInitial release, core functionality included wifi monitoring and volume muting/unmuting based on user preferences, and a setup screen that shows the wifi networks that have been connected to by the user in reverse chronological order.\r\n\r\n###1.1 (December 2015)\r\nFirst update with the following changes:\r\n- Replaced segmented control in setup screen with a pop-up menu (segmented controls didn't work in El Capitan)\r\n- Added emojis to setup options for non-english speaking users\r\n- Added \"Not connected to any network\" option to the setup menu\r\n- Added a 10 second timer when wifi drops (to avoid detecting small drops in wifi)\r\n- Changed setup window to always be on top to avoid losing it behind other windows\r\n\r\n# Developer Guide\r\nI've decided to make AutoMute open source and I welcome all feedback, issues, and pull requests. This is my first time making something open source, so if I'm doing something wrong or poorly please let me know!\r\n\r\nAutoMute was written in Swift 2 using Xcode 7 beta 6. Here are some quick descriptions of the main classes in the app:\r\n\r\n- WifiManager - Monitors the current wifi network and the user's preferences and makes a delegate call when the wifi network changes.\r\n- AppDelegate - Receives calls from the WifiManager and displays the status item and menu.\r\n- SetupViewController - Essentially just a tableview that uses the WifiManager as a data source.\r\n\r\n# Licensing\r\nSee the file named \"LICENSE\".","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
