Constantly forgetting to mute your sound when you get to school or work?\r\n\r\n![Closing Laptop](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d89f9646e730659b163c31d653f96c3299694e42/687474703a2f2f6769616e742e6766796361742e636f6d2f436f6e7363696f757346656d696e696e654972756b616e646a696a656c6c79666973682e676966)\r\n\r\nAutoMute allows you to tell your computer to mute or unmute your Macbook when you connect to certain wifi networks, eliminating the need to remember to mute and unmute your laptop every day and giving you the peace of mind that your laptop won't start playing sounds in the middle of class or in the office.\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n![AutoMute Menu](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a4f0ca40d841e12eee31277e2bb0648081fdd735/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f527763506871662e706e67)\r\n\r\n![AutoMute Setup](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/27e7f59d4a9a7c54ce8782a56c7bdf7d9995bc26/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f697961746535752e706e67)\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\nAutoMute has a super easy one-time setup. When you first launch the app, it shows a list of your most recently used wifi networks and you tell it what you want to happen when you connect to each one. Once everything is set up, you can close the preferences window and AutoMute will work in the background. \r\n\r\nAs long as you see the AutoMute icon on your status bar, AutoMute is working. This is also where you can change the settings any time you like.\r\n\r\n# Developer Guide\r\nAutoMute was written in Swift 2 using Xcode 7 beta 6.\r\n\r\n- WifiManager - Monitors the current wifi network and the user's preferences and makes a delegate call when the wifi network changes.\r\n- AppDelegate - Receives calls from the WifiManager and displays the status item and menu.\r\n- SetupViewController - Essentially just a tableview that uses the WifiManager as a data source.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
