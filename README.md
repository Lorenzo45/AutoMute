# AutoMute
Have a laptop that you use both for work and personal use? Constantly trying to remember to mute your sound when you get to school or work? 

Well I sure did, and after two years of hearing laptops go off in univerisity (mine included), I got the idea to use the current wifi network to know when you're at school and automatically mute the sound. I figured this could easily be done with some kind of macro, but I couldn't find a program that had the capability to do this. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and write a status bar application for it.
